think about OP as making a tree that has end nodes of X,Y. what other end nodes can work. What other compositions work to create these trees? 

in group G with element g, such that a*g^n=b for every a,b. //* is some operation, not necicaliry multiplication
	op(x,y)={x*g,  x==y
			  {c,    x!=y     // c in G
	perhaps some groups have element O such that 
	aOb = op(a,b) -- nope, it no existy
		a!=b!=c!=d
		((aOb)Ob)Oa!=(aOb)O(bOa)
